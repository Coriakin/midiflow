# About MIDIFlow

MIDIFlow is a focused web-based tin whistle practice application that provides real-time visual feedback through MIDI input. Practice songs with step-by-step guidance and see your progress in real-time.
Initially focus is on tinwhisle and uilleann pipes, but I do not see why this tool cannot also be a more generic one for other midi instruments.

## Note from author
I have always wanted to improve my tooting, but seldom find time and always looking for structured ways to get some practice in with songs I like and find around the web. This project is an attempt to do something that I can use, and once it is mature enough I hope it will be of joy for others out there as well!
