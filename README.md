## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (recommended - full WebMIDI support)
- ⚠️ Firefox (limited WebMIDI, BLE fallback planned)
- ❌ Safari (WebMIDI not supported yet)

## Testing Without Hardware

For testing without a physical MIDI device, you can:
1. Use a virtual MIDI port (like loopMIDI on Windows)
2. Use a software MIDI controller
3. Some DAWs can send MIDI to browser applications

## MIDI File Support & Preview

The app supports standard MIDI files (.mid/.midi) with advanced preview capabilities:

### Supported MIDI Features
- Note On/Off events with velocity and timing
- Program Change (instrument selection)
- Tempo changes and time signatures
- Multiple tracks and channels
- Standard MIDI File Format 0 and 1
- Efficient binary data storage for persistence

## Persistent Storage

All songs are automatically saved and restored:

### What's Persisted
- **MIDI Files**: Complete binary data, track selections, and metadata
